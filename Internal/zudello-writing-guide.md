# Zudello writing guide

This guide is for anyone writing public-facing content or communication for Zudello. Aligning all documentation with this guide ensures a consistent experience for our customers across all Zudello communication. 

## Language - British English

## Active vs passive voice

Write in the active voice:

Subject (person/thing acting) verb (the action) object (receives the action)

Signs of passive voice:

- Object before subject (e.g., "the item was purchased by the customer")
- Past tense verbs ("was added", "was created")
- Forms of "to be" ("was", "is", "were")

Use passive voice only when:

- Avoiding referring to yourself or Zudello
- Making clear you didn't personally take an action
- The object is more important than the subject
- Invoices are created monthly and emailed to mark.li@email.com ✅
- Zudello creates and emails your invoices monthly to simon.r@email.com ❌


## Contractions

Use contractions for a casual tone, except when they sound awkward:

- You can't have products with negative prices ✅
- Your products don't have units of measure ✅
- An error occurred and your changes couldn't be saved ✅
- There're 10 products in this collection ❌
- You gotta select a submodule before uploading a document ❌
- This order needn't be approved ❌

##  Plain language

- Use words your users use
- Keep sentences short with a single focus
- Aim for a high school reading level
- Don’t use technical jargon or complex terminology

  
## Capitalisation 

The two types of capitalisation that Zudello uses are title case and sentence case. Details of each case, and when to use them (the case for each case, if you will) can be found below: 
### Title Case 

To use title case: 

- Begin major words with a capital letter, including nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs 
- Do not capitalise articles like 'a', 'an', or 'the' unless they begin or end the title 
- Do not capitalise prepositions like 'in', 'to' or 'from' 
- Do not capitalise conjunctions like 'and' or 'or' 
- Always capitalise the first and last word, regardless of their function 

### Sentence Case 

To use sentence case: 

- Capitalise the first word 
- Capitalise proper/trademarked nouns 
- Lowercase everything else 

### Within the Zudello UI
