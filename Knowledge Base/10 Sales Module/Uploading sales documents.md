# Uploading sales documents

 Getting your documents into Zudello's sales submodule is the first step in streamlining your  accounts receivable processes. This guide explains how to upload documents to the sales module and ensure they're processed correctly.

## Best practices

To ensure smooth document processing:

- Select the correct sales submodule before uploading documents
- Review the accepted document formats guide before uploading
- Avoid creating new versions of documents (e.g. by printing to PDF) before uploading them to Zudello
- Review potential duplicates carefully before deletion
- Consider using email upload to save time

## Upload methods

### Email upload

To upload documents via email, simply send your documents as email attachments to your Zudello mailbox. That's it!

Zudello will automatically identify and extract any valid documents. The submodule for each document is identified as part of extraction, allowing you to use one central mailbox for all documents in each Zudello module.  

To find your team's mailbox address:

1. Click the company menu at the top right
2. Click **Settings**
3. Click **Mailboxes**
4. View the list of inbox addresses:
	- Mailbox names appear on the left
	- Email addresses to send documents to appear on the right
	- Click the copy icon to copy an email address

If you cannot view inbox settings, please contact your organisation administrator. 

### Manual upload

To manually upload documents:

1. Select the sales submodule you want to upload documents to
2. To upload a document via drag and drop:
	1. Drag and drop the file anywhere onto the submodule screen
	2. Wait for confirmation of the upload
3. To select a document to upload:
	1. Click **New invoice**
	2. Click **Click here to upload**
	3. Select the file to upload

Important notes:
