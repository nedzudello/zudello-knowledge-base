Ensure your documents are extracted as soon as possible by setting up customised Zudello inboxes. 
#### Unlimited, customisable inboxes 

Zudello's inboxes allow you to configure as many inboxes as required by your business. For each inbox, you can customise the following:
- The local name (the part of the email address before the **@**)
- The display name within Zudello, to allow you to easily identify inboxes
- The **reply to** address
- The Zudello module that the inbox relates to

#### Default coding

Inboxes can be configured to apply default location and/or subsidiary coding to all documents received by the inbox. This coding can work in conjunction with other supplier/item default coding and keyword automations.
