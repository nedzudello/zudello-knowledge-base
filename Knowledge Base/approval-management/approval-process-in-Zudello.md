# Approval process in Zudello

Zudello provides a consistent approval process across your organisation. This guide explains how approvals work in Zudello and how to manage them effectively.

## Understanding the approval flow

The Zudello approval process automatically assigns the appropriate user/s to a document based on a predetermined approval flow. 

When you open a document in Approval status, you'll see the approval flow at the top left. The approval flow consists of three main elements:

- Approval milestones
- Approval steps
- Approvers

### Approval milestones

Approval milestones represent distinct parts of the approval process. Each milestone:

- Has a name to provide context 
- Contains one or more approval steps
- Shows its status through a coloured square indicator:
  - Purple: Active milestone
  - Green: Completed milestone
  - Grey: Future milestone

Milestones may appear one at a time for standalone approvals, or all at once for complex flows like DOA or management tree approvals. All steps within a milestone must be approved for the document to progress.

If a milestone is approved, it continues to the next step in processing. If a milestone is rejected, it moves to **Reject Review** status to be reviewed.

### Approval steps

Each milestone contains one or more approval steps. Each step:

- Has a name to provide context about the current approvers
- Shows how many approvals are required to proceed
- Shows approval history for previously completed steps
- Shows details of any special approval actions like force approval, change of approver, or escalation
### Managing approvers

If you have the right permissions, you can reassign approvals to different users:
 
1. Click the **Change User** icon next to the approver's name
2. Select the new approver from the drop-down menu
3. Once changed, click the **Others** arrow to view previously assigned approvers and the reason for the change

## Additional notes

- Documents within the approval flow appear in Approval status by default, though your team may have custom status configurations
- Rejected documents will restart the approval process when resubmitted
