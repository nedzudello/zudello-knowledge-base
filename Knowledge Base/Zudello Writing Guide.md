# Zudello Writing Guide

This guide is for anyone writing public-facing content or communication for Zudello. Aligning all documentation with this guide ensures a consistent experience for our customers across all Zudello communication. 

## Language - British English

## Active vs passive voice

Write in the active voice:

Subject (person/thing acting) verb (the action) object (receives the action)

The **active voice** has the subject taking the initiative, performing the action, and (usually) achieving a result.  
e.g. Zudello (subject) makes (strong, present tense verb) manual data entry (object) a thing of the past (result).  ✅

The **passive voice** has the object being acted upon by a subject. It makes the object of the sentence appear to lack agency and seem weak and submissive. The subject is relegated to the end of the sentence.  
e.g. Manual data entry (object) has been made (weak, past tense, compound verb) a thing of the past by Zudello (subject). ❌

Signs of passive voice:

- Object before subject (e.g., "the item was purchased by the customer")
- Past tense verbs ("was added", "was created")
- Forms of "to be" ("was", "is", "were")
- The word ‘by’ is often found in passive sentences

Use passive voice only when:

- Avoiding referring to yourself or Zudello
- Making clear you didn't personally take an action
- The object is more important than the subject
- Invoices are created monthly and emailed to mark.li@email.com ✅
- Zudello creates and emails your invoices monthly to simon.r@email.com ❌

## Log in vs login

- "Log in" (two words) is a verb phrase - it's what you do when you enter your credentials to access an account:
	- I need to log in to my email  ✅ 
	- Please log in to continue  ✅ 
	- You will need to login again ❌
- Login (one word) is a noun or adjective - it refers to the credentials or the process itself:
	- The login page isn't loading  ✅ 
	- Enter your login details below  ✅ 
	- If you have forgotten your log in information ❌
- An easy way to remember: if you can replace it with "sign in," use two words (log in). If you can replace it with "username" or "credentials," use one word (login).

## Toggles and radio buttons

- Refer to toggles and radio buttons as options only if required. Otherwise, just use the name of the toggle/button.
- Options are either turned on or turned off (not enabled, selected, toggled off, or anything else).
- Turned on, turn on, turning on, turns on.
- Bold the name of an option like you would a button.
- Examples:
	- Turn on the **Delegate duties** option ✅ 
	- Turn off **Are the line totals inclusive of tax?** ✅ 
	- Disable the **Verify email** option ❌

## Checkboxes 

- Refer to checkboxes as the name of the option if the name is short and each name is unique. Otherwise, refer to them as checkboxes.
- If using the name of the option, bold the name and match the case in the UI.
- Checkboxes are selected or deselected (not turned on, toggle off, unchecked, or enabled).
- Examples:
	- Select **Ready**, **User Review** and any other statuses you would like to view ✅ 
	- Select the checkbox at the start of each row that you would like to delete ✅ 
	- Check **Approval** to view only invoices awaiting approval ❌
	- Select **Step Name** at the start of each dataset row you want to delete ❌

## Drop-down menus
