# Setting up approval delegation

Approval delegation lets you temporarily assign your approval responsibilities to another user when you're unavailable. This guide explains how to set up and manage delegations effectively.

## Best practices

- Review delegation settings regularly to ensure they are correct
- Only delegate to users with appropriate authority levels
- Set clear start (from) and end (until) dates for your delegation period
- Remove any delegation as soon as it is no longer needed, even if you have an end date set
- Consider whether to include existing approval requests in your delegation
- Consider whether it is necessary to delegate your duties as well as your approvals

## Before you begin

Before setting up a delegation:
- Confirm the user you plan to delegate to has sufficient authority within your organisation to action your approvals
- Remember that delegation is configured per team, so you can set different delegates for different teams
- Remember that organisation administrators can view and edit delegation settings for all users

## Setting up delegation

1. Click the company menu at the top right of your screen
2. Click **Profile**
