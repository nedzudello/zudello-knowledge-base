# Deleting and archiving documents

Keep your workspace free of unnecessary documents through deletion and archiving. This guide explains when and how to use these features effectively.

## Best practices

- Use deletion only for documents that should not have been uploaded to or created in Zudello
- Archive documents that were uploaded to Zudello, but processed manually to your ERP
- Review documents carefully before deleting or archiving
- Minimise use of bulk actions for deleting and archiving to avoid mistakes

## Deleting documents

### Deleting a single document

1. Open the document you want to delete
2. Click **...** at the top of the document
3. Click the delete icon
4. The document will automatically close after deletion

### Deleting multiple documents

1. Select the checkbox next to each document you want to delete
2. Look for the bulk actions bar at the bottom of your screen
3. Click **Status**
4. Select **Deleted** from the options

## Archiving documents

We recommend archiving over deletion for documents that:

- Were uploaded to Zudello but processed manually in another system
- Need to be retained but no longer need to be processed
- Should be separated from deleted documents and documents that were pushed from Zudello into your ERP

### Archiving a single document

1. Open the document you want to archive
2. Click **...** at the top of the document
3. Scroll down and click **Archive**
4. The document will automatically close after archiving

### Archiving multiple documents

1. Select the checkbox next to each document you want to archive
2. Look for the bulk actions bar at the bottom of your screen
3. Click **Status**
4. Select **Archive** from the options
