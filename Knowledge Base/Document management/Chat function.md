# Chat function

Effective team communication is essential for document collaboration. This guide explains how to use Zudello's document chat to communicate with your team members directly within documents.

## Best practices

- Mention specific team members to ensure they receive notifications
- Keep document-related discussions within the document chat
- Use file attachments to provide additional context
- Write clear, concise messages
- Write additional messages for updates, rather than editing or deleting old messages

## Accessing document chat

1. Open the document you want to discuss
2. Click the chat icon at the top right of the modal

## Chat functions

### Writing a message

1. Write your message in the box at the bottom of the tab
2. Click **Send**

### Mentioning team members

When you mention someone, they receive an email notification with a direct link to the document, provided they have the appropriate notification preferences turned on.

To notify specific team members:

1. Click **@** in the chat
2. Select the user's name from the drop-down menu
    - Search by first or last name to find team members quickly
3. Write your message
4. Click **Send**

> If a user does not have notifications for chat mentions enabled, they will not receive an email. Be sure to monitor any sent chat messages to ensure you receive a reply.

### Attaching files

You can attach supporting files in your chat messages:

1. Click the attach icon
2. Select your file
3. Click **Send**

Supported file types include:

- Images (PNG, JPEG)
- Documents (PDF, DOC)
- Data files (CSV, spreadsheets)

### Managing messages

Chat messages appear in chronological order. You can:

- View the full conversation history
- Edit and delete your own messages
- Track when messages were sent
