# Related documents and attachments

Documents within Zudello will often have connections to other documents or need supporting files. This guide explains how to link related documents and add attachments in Zudello to keep your records organised and comprehensive.

## Best practices

- Link documents promptly to maintain clear audit trails
- Add supporting attachments only when required
- Review related documents before processing to ensure all information is considered

## Managing related documents
