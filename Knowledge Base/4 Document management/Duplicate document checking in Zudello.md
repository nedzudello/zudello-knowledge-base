# Duplicate document checking in Zudello

Zudello helps prevent unnecessary work and overpayments through automated duplicate checking at multiple stages. This guide explains how duplicate checking works and what to do when duplicates are found.

## Best practices

To ensure the fastest and most accurate duplicate checking within your teams:

- Avoid creating new versions of documents (e.g. by printing to PDF) before uploading them to Zudello
- Review potential duplicates carefully before deletion
- Verify external system records when alerted to possible duplicates
- Ask customers and suppliers to use unique, non-repeated document numbers 
- Ensure all users on your team are familiar with the following duplicate checking procedures

## Understanding duplicate checks

Zudello performs duplicate checking at three key points:

1. When documents are uploaded
2. When documents are opened, against other documents in Zudello
3. When documents are opened, against your external accounting system

### On-upload duplicate detection

When you upload a document, Zudello automatically checks if that exact document has been processed before:

- For manual uploads, you'll receive an error message with a link to view the existing document
- For emailed documents, Zudello automatically moves duplicates into a hidden **Duplicate** status

### Document opening duplicate detection

Each time you open a document, Zudello checks for existing documents with matching:

- Document type
- Document number
- Matched supplier/customer

If a potential duplicate is found within Zudello, you'll see the following message at the top of the document:

> A possible duplicate was found. **View duplicate**

If a potential duplicate is found within your external system, you'll see the following message at the top of the document:

> A possible duplicate was found in your accounting system

## Handling potential duplicates

### Handling duplicates within Zudello

When a potential duplicate is identified within Zudello:

1. Click **View Duplicate** to compare the documents side by side
2. Review both documents carefully to determine if they are true duplicates
3. If they are duplicates:
    - Click **Delete** under the document you want to remove
    - Click **Yes** to confirm deletion
4. If they are not duplicates:
    - Ignore the warning
    - Continue processing the documents as normal

### External system duplicates

When Zudello identifies a potential duplicate in your external system:

1. Stop processing the document
2. Check your external accounting system
3. Verify whether you have already received and processed the document
4. Determine if further processing is needed
5. If the document is a duplicate, archive it within Zudello
6. If the document is not a duplicate, continue processing as normal
