# Document processing and extraction in Zudello

We know that efficient document processing is crucial for your business operations. This guide explains how Zudello processes your documents to minimise manual work and maximise automation.

## Best practices

- Upload documents in standard formats to ensure successful processing
- Set up supplier defaults and coding rules beforehand to improve automation
- Review document statuses regularly to track processing progress
- Configure user and inbox defaults to streamline processing

## Document processing stages

When you upload a document to Zudello, it goes through several automated stages:

### Document validation

Zudello performs initial checks to ensure your document can be processed successfully:

- Confirms the document type is valid
- Checks for duplicate documents
- Verifies the document is not corrupted

### Information extraction

After validation, Zudello extracts information from your document:

- Captures key data points from the document
- Maps extracted information to the correct fields in Zudello
- Prepares the data for enrichment

### Data enrichment

During enrichment, Zudello matches and enhances the extracted information using your existing data:

1. Supplier matching
    - Matches supplier details using extracted information
    - Checks against supplier name, ABN, email, and phone number
2. Line item processing
    - Matches line items to your item codes
    - Uses SKU information from the document
3. Automated coding
    - Applies keyword coding rules for your team
    - Sets user default coding or inbox default coding
    - Applies supplier defaults to empty or all fields
    - Implements item default coding

### Status updates

Once processing completes, your document moves from scanning status to either:

- Ready status, or
- User review status

You can then begin working with the processed document.
