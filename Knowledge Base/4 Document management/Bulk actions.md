# Bulk actions

We know that performing the same action on multiple records can be time-consuming. With bulk actions, you can easily edit multiple records at once.

## Understanding bulk actions

Bulk actions let you perform the same operation on multiple records at once. Available actions vary by submodule but may include:

- Assigning users to records
- Changing record statuses  
- Exporting records
- Performing quick actions  
- Deleting records

## Selecting records for bulk actions 

To select records for bulk actions:

1. Go to the submodule containing the records you want to action
2. Select records using one of these methods:
   - Click the checkbox to the left of each record you want to select
   - Click the three dots next to **Status** and click **Select all** to select all records in that status

> Some bulk actions can only be performed on records within the same module.
> 
> Select all will only select the records that are currently loaded (batches of 30). To load and select more, scroll down on records until the next batch of 30 appear. Once your desired number are loaded, click **Select all**.
> 
> For best performance, we recommend performing bulk actions on fewer than a maximum of 100 records at a time.

After selecting records, the bulk action bar appears at the bottom of your screen, showing the number of available actions.

## Working with bulk actions

When performing bulk actions, remember:

- The available actions depend on your submodule
- If you select records that are ineligible for a particular bulk action, Zudello will skip those records and process the rest
- You can deselect individual records if you need to remove them from the bulk action

## Best practices

- Carefully review your selected records before performing bulk actions
- Use the **Select all** option only when you need to action every record in a particular status
- Check that all selected records are eligible for your intended action
