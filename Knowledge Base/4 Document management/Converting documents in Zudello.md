# Converting documents in Zudello

Converting lets you move resources between different modules and submodules in Zudello. This guide explains how to convert documents and what to expect during the conversion process.

> Currently, conversion is only available for transaction-based modules (Sales, Purchasing, and Expenses)

## Best practices

- Review the target module and submodule before converting
- Consider whether you need to convert the original document or create a converted duplicate
- Double-check your selection before starting the conversion

## Understanding document conversion

Zudello offers two types of document conversion:

- Convert
	- Moves the resource to your selected module and submodule
- Duplicate and convert 
	- Creates a copy of the resource in the new module/submodule and creates a link between both documents

Note that conversion is currently restricted to transaction-based modules and submodules. You cannot convert records in the following modules:
- Relationships
- Inventory
- Dimensions

## Converting a document

To convert a document:

1. Open the document
2. Click **...** at the top of the document
3. Click **Convert**
4. From the **Module** drop-down, select your target module
5. From the **Submodule** drop-down, select your target sub-module
6. To create a linked duplicate instead of moving the original:
   - Turn on the **Duplicate** option
7. Click **Convert**

The system then begins converting the document. Once complete, you will be redirected to a new tab with the converted document opened. 

### Working with duplicated conversions

When you use duplicate and convert:

- Zudello creates a duplicate in your selected location
- Both documents are linked to each other via the **Related documents** tab
- The duplicate opens in a new tab automatically
- You can continue processing both documents independently
