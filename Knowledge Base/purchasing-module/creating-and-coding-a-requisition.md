## Creating a requisition

This article details how to create a requisition and submit it for approval. This process can also be used to code and submit requisitions that were converted from a quote or duplicated from an existing requisition. 

> If your team creates and approves purchase orders directly, see [creating-and-coding-a-purchase-order](creating-and-coding-a-purchase-order.md).

Contact your organisation administrator if you are unsure of the document flow for your team.

### Creating and coding a requisition

To begin coding a new purchase order, you can either:

- Create a new requisition
	1. Click the **Requisition** submodule
	2. Click **New Requisition**
	3. Click **Create**
- Find a converted requisition
	1. Find the existing requisition using filters or the search bar if needed
	2. Click the requisition to open it
> For help converting a quote to a requisition, see [converting-a-quote-to-a-requisition-or-purchase-order](converting-a-quote-to-a-requisition-or-purchase-order.md).
- Duplicate and edit an existing requisition:
	1. Find the existing requisition using filters or the search bar if needed
	2. Click the requisition to open it
	3. Click **...** at the top of the document
	4. Click **Duplicate**

Code the requisition:

1. Click **Type** and select the relevant requisition type from the drop-down menu
2. Complete all header level information
	- Fill in the document number
	    - If document numbers are greyed out, your team uses auto-generation
	    - If entering manually, follow your team's numbering conventions
	- Fill in or check date fields, currency and any other required field
	- Select a company:
	    - Click **Match with this supplier**
	    - Search and select the supplier from the drop-down menu
	- Add a delivery address, or choose from an existing address
3. Enter line level information
	- Double-click the stock code field and search by SKU or description
	- Enter or edit the line description if required
	- Fill in any required coding fields by double-clicking the field and selecting from the drop-down
	- Fill in the required quantities and check or enter the pricing
    - Line totals will be calculated automatically
4. Document totals will automatically calculate based on line items
	- If line prices include tax, turn on **Are the line totals inclusive of tax?** 
	- Double-check all totals 
5. Click **Save and submit**

The requisition will then move through your team's approval process. Once approved, it will automatically convert into a purchase order and continue through the purchasing document flow. 

For more information on the standard flow of purchasing documents, see [standard-purchasing-flows](standard-purchasing-flows.md).
