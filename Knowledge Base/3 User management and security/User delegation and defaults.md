# User delegation and defaults

While users can manage their own settings, we know that organisation administrators may need to control these settings for their team members from time to time. 
This guide explains how organisation administrators can manage delegation, default coding, and default team settings for other users.

## Best practices

- Review user settings regularly to ensure they align with organisational requirements
- Double-check delegation settings before making changes
- Consider the impact of changes on team workflows
- Document any significant changes made to user settings
- Communicate changes to affected users

## Accessing user settings

1. Click the company menu at the top right of your screen
2. Click your organisation name
3. Click **Users**
4. Find the user whose settings you want to edit
5. Click the edit icon next to the user

## Managing delegation settings

To add or edit delegation settings:

1. Click the **Team settings** drop-down and select the team you want to configure delegation for
2. Click **Delegation** to expand the delegation section
