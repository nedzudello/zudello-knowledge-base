# User security best practices

Maintaining strong security practices helps protect your organisation's data and systems. This guide explains key security measures and best practices for managing users in Zudello.

## Best practices

- Review user access and permissions regularly
- Use single sign-on (SSO) where available
- If not using SSO, enforce strong password requirements. Ensure passwords:
	- Contain at least 12 characters
    - Include uppercase and lowercase letters
    - Include numbers and special characters
    - Don't contain common words or patterns
- If you are using password sign-on, use multi-factor authentication (MFA)  
- Document all security-related changes
- Remove access immediately when off-boarding users
- Regularly audit user group permissions and group memberships

## Configuring user groups and data permissions

- Set up team-specific user groups:
    - Create groups based on job functions
    - Assign minimum required permissions
    - Review group membership monthly
- Configure data permissions on a need-to-know basis:
    - Set up resource-level access controls
    - Use "Own" access where possible
    - Limit "All" access to essential users

## Regular security reviews

### Quarterly access review

Perform these checks at a minimum every three months:

1. Review the users list:
    - Check for any unfamiliar accounts
    - Verify all active accounts belong to current staff
    - Deactivate accounts for users who have left
2. Review user group membership:
    - Verify all user groups are still required
    - Expand each group
    - Verify members need their assigned access
3. Review data permissions:
    - Check permission assignments match security requirements
    - Verify that all user groups assigned to each data permission still require access to all resources

## Delegation security

When setting up user delegation:

- Set specific time periods:
    - Always include both start and end dates
    - Keep delegation periods as short as possible
- Ensure users communicate their delegation changes with all other affected staff

## Responding to security incidents

If you notice unusual activity:

1. Take immediate action:
    - Deactivate affected user accounts
    - Remove suspicious group memberships
    - Document the incident details
2. Review security settings:
    - Check user group permissions
    - Verify data permission assignments
    - Update access controls as needed
