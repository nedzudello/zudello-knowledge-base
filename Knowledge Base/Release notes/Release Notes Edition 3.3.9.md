# New & improved

### Allocations - custom field autofilling

Zudello's autofill feature allows you to process transactions faster than ever, by autofilling coding from linked transactions (e.g. autofilling invoice line coding from the allocated PO lines).
# Resolutions

We are constantly working to refine Zudello functionality and ensure that any issues are addressed as soon as possible. As part of this release, we have made the following resolutions and improvements:

- We resolved an issue where Keyword Coding Rules were not correctly applied due to case sensitivity. All keyword lookup rules are now case insensitive
