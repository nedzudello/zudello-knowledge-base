# Business rules overview

Zudello's business rules automate routine coding to help your team work smarter, not harder. These intelligent features help minimise your interaction with documents, freeing your team to focus on what matters most.

Transform how you handle incoming documents with:

- [[Keyword coding rules]]
    - Automatically apply predefined values when specific keywords appear on an extracted document
- Default coding
    - Automatically apply default coding for certain items and suppliers
- Dependencies 
	- Prevent invalid combinations before they happen, by limiting the available options in one field based on what you select in another field

Zudello's business rules allow your team to focus on higher-value activities that drive your business forward. You gain the flexibility to configure rules that match your business needs, while Zudello handles the heavy lifting of applying them consistently across all transactions.

Business rules can be managed either through your ERP system or directly in Zudello, giving you the freedom to choose what works best for your organisation. As your business evolves, your rules can too.
